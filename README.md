# Front End TechDegree Project 1
 In the first project of my Front End TechDegree with Treehouse, I was tasked in updating and modifying a source file for a personal profile page and adding my own touch to it. 
 
This project was created using HTML & CSS, built in VS Code, and tested in Chrome Version 77.0.3865.120
