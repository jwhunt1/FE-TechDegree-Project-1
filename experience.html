          <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
          <p>Started learning early 2019 with my cousin. We read <cite>HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites</cite> by Jon Duckett and used the
          website FreeCodeCamp to learn these skills in practice. I completed the Responsive Web Design course in July 2019 and went on to learn
          through the website <cite>Treehouse</cite>.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>Started with <cite>JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development.</cite> by Jon Ducket and am continuing to read that while
          learning Front-End Web Development through <cite>Treehouse</cite>. I plan to start learning React and Angular shortly into my JavaScript journey
        and hope to continue to push my skills into learning TypeScript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>SQL</h2>
          <p>The class focuses on MS SQL Server and we use SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) to interact with databases.
            My eventual goal is to become a Full Stack Developer but while focusing Front-End I noticed a flyer for a local SQL class.
            I had enough money saved up and nothing beats face to face learning. My instructor is a highly skilled developer and engineer who
            has helped me greatly.
